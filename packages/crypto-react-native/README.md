# `@helium/crypto-react-native`

## Getting Started

```
yarn add @helium/crypto-react-native
```

`@helium/crypto-react-native` requires that the `react-native-sodium` dependency be added directly to your project so that the underlying native dependency can be autolinked.

```
yarn add react-native-sodium
```

On iOS, install pods:

```
cd ios && pod install
```
